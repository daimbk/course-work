"""
Lab Task:

For this lab you will be implementing Breadth First on a graph.

For this lab you are provided with one helper classes.
It is for making a graph.
You may open then the file, once opened you'll see descriptions for each function defined
and a testing code for the class in the main body. Kindly go through them to get comfortable
with the functions

MAIN TASK:
The graph provided has already been created below and the DFS (Breadth First Search) function has been called.
You are suppose to fill in the DFS function declared below. A description of what the function should do is mentioned.
Use functions from the helper class in order to write the UCS function.
Your function should print the path.
