"""
Lab Task:

For this lab you will be implementing A* (A Star Search) on a graph.
The picture of the graph can be found in assets directory.

For this lab you are provided with two helper classes.
One is for making a graph and the other one in an interface for Priority Queues.
You may open then these file, once opened you'll see descriptions for each function defined
and a testing code for the class in the main body. Kindly go through them to get comfortable
with the functions

MAIN TASKS:

    1- Modify graph.py to have the ability to store heuristics
    2- Create a funciton 'get_h' in graph.py to get heuristic for a node : input will be a Node and output will be heuristic
    3- Create the graph in graph.py to and check all the functions
    4- Implement A* function

Your function should print the shortest path along with the cost of that path.
A sample output is provided in the assests directory.
